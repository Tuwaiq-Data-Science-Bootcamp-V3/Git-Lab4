I am a fresh graduate developer majoring in Artificial Intelligence. Iâ€™m interested in web development, Image processing, deep learning, computer vision, 3d modeling, and game development. I recently practice many programming projects using python. I hope to be able to combine my passion for learning with my programming skills to create new products or design useful solutions for people.
